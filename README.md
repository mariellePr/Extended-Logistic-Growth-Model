This Python code is associated to the submitted manuscript "A Single Population Approach to Modeling Growth and Decay in Batch Bioreactors", Carlos Matinez von Dossow, Marielle Péré.
Its purpose is to calibrate the models presented in this paper to data from different studies on batch culture.
It organizes data from 6 different papers:
 * Ljumggren, 1994 (from Goudar, 2005),
 * Linz, 1997 (from Goudar, 2005),
 * Bayley, 2012,
 * Wright, 2009,
 * Torres, 2020,
 * Amrane, 1998,
and presents the corresponding calibration of model M1 and M2 results.

Therefore three figures are generated:
 * Figure 3 of the paper 
 ![Figure3](images/Figure_3.png)
 * Figure 4 of the paper
 ![Figure4](images/Figure_4.png)
 * An additionnal figure, including calibration of the models for data from the 6 articles presented above.
  ![additionnal_figure](images/Additionnal_figure.png)
 
 
The code is organized in three parts: Import, Functions and Main with a function per figure named accordingly.
